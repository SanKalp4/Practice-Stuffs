HSBC, as a financial institution, must adhere to regulatory updates across jurisdictions. It relies on third-party vendor RegRoom, which aggregates regulatory information into alerts stored on an AWS server called APM. These alerts are accessed via the RAPID web application by the COE team. Currently, manual analysis of each alert by the COE team is time-consuming. The RAPID to optimization model, utilizing natural language processing and machine learning, provides top recommendations for risk-toward areas, themes, and classifications. For new alerts, it suggests similar existing records. This streamlines the tagging process, enabling quicker decision-making and reducing operational time. It's estimated to save the COE team members around 25% of their time, equating to seven to eight minutes per triage instance.
